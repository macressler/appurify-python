# Appurify Python Client

The official Python client for the [Appurify](http://www.appurify.com) API.

### Installation

```
pip install appurify-0.2.9.tar.gz
```

This will install any missing dependencies and add two executable scripts to your bin folder:

```
$ appurify-client.py -h
$ appurify-tunnel.py -h
```

### Running Tests

```
appurify-client.py --api-key $API_KEY --api-secret $API_SECRET \
--app-src $APP-SRC --app-test-type $TEST_TYPE --test-src $TEST_SRC --test-type $TEST_TYPE \
--device-type-id $DEVICE_TYPE_IDS --result-dir $RESULT_DIR
```

### Starting Tunnel

```
appurify-tunnel.py --api-key $API_KEY --api-secret $API_SECRET
```

To provide local/private network environment to your tests, they must be started after tunnel has been established.

### Parameters

- `API_KEY`: Used for authentication
- `API_SECRET`: Used for authentication
- `APP_SRC`: The path or URL to the app binary (.ipa or .apk)
- `TEST_SRC`: The path or URL where the test files are located
- `TEST_TYPE`: Your test framework name e.g. calabash, ios_robot, ocunit, uiautomation. See [constants.py](https://github.com/appurify/appurify-python/blob/master/appurify/constants.py#L63) for list of supported test types.
- `DEVICE_TYPE_IDS`: A comma separated list of numbers representing the device type IDs you wish to use for your test
- `RESULT_DIR`: The directory on your local machine where you want your results to be written.

### Jenkins Integration

In Jenkins create a new Execute Shell build step and upload your app using the Python wrapper as pictured below.

### Exit codes

To facilitate error reporting, the client will report one of the following error codes on exit:

|Code| Meaning |
|----|---------|
| 0  | Test completed with no exceptions or errors |
| 1  | Test completed normally but reported test failures |
| 2  | Test was aborted by the user or system |
| 3  | Test was aborted by the system because of timeout |
| 4  | Test could not be completed because the device could not be activated or reserved |
| 5  | Test could not execute because there was an error in the configuration or uploaded files |
| 6  | Test could not execute because the server rejected the provided credentials|
| 7  | Test could not execute because of other server/remote exception |
| 8  | Test could not execute because of an unexpected error in the client |
| 9  | Test got a connection error attempting to reach the server  |
| 10  | The app could not be installed on the device (possibly due to incorrect build) |
| 11  | Test could not execute because device type is not found in user pool  |
| 12  | Test could not execute because app is not built for device type |
| 13  |  Device doesn't exist in users device pool |
| 14  |  App is not compabtible with device specified. |
| 15  |  Test reached timeout for grid session |
